def main_function():

    Executes data processing and utility operations, returning the processed data as a string.

    This function initializes a `HelperClass` instance to manage and process data, invokes a utility function to provide a placeholder value, and generates a static timestamp for consistency in logging or testing scenarios. The function is useful when a complete data processing sequence is needed, integrating utility operations to produce a final result.

    Returns:
        str: The processed data result as a string, derived from the `HelperClass` instance after executing the data processing and utility functions.

    Example:
        # Execute the main function to process data and retrieve the result
        result = main_function()
        print(result)  # Output: '[1, 2, 3]'

    Returns a utility string.

    This function provides a simple utility string, which can be used in various contexts where a placeholder or a generic return value is needed. It is typically used within workflows that require a consistent return value for testing or demonstration purposes.

    Returns:
        str: The string 'utility', serving as a generic utility value.

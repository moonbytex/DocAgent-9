class HelperClass:
    """
    Represents a utility for managing and processing data.

    The `HelperClass` is designed to facilitate data processing tasks by leveraging the `DataProcessor` class. It serves as an intermediary that manages the workflow of data processing, making it easier to handle data updates and retrievals within a system. This class is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be processed and accessed in a structured manner.

    The `HelperClass` fits into the larger system architecture as a component that coordinates data processing tasks. It achieves its purpose by using the `DataProcessor` to perform the actual data processing and then managing the processed data internally.

    Example:
        # Initialize the HelperClass
        helper = HelperClass()

        # Process data using the helper
        helper.process_data()

        # Retrieve the processed data result
        result = helper.get_result()
        print(result)  # Output: '[1, 2, 3]'

    Attributes:
        data (list): Stores the processed data, initially an empty list.

        Processes and updates the internal data.

        This method orchestrates the data processing workflow by invoking the `DataProcessor.process()` method to perform the main data processing task. It then calls `_internal_process()` to finalize the processing and update the internal `data` attribute. Use this method when you need to refresh or initialize the data within the `HelperClass` instance.

            None: This method updates the internal state and does not return a value.

        This class is designed to perform simple data processing operations, providing
        utility methods that can be used in various scenarios where basic data manipulation
        is required. It is particularly useful in contexts where a straightforward list of
        integers is needed for further processing or testing.

        The `DataProcessor` class fits into the larger system architecture as a utility
        component, offering static and internal methods to handle specific processing tasks.
        It achieves its purpose by providing a static method for general use and an internal
        method for class-specific operations.

        Example:
            # Initialize the DataProcessor class
            processor = DataProcessor()

            # Use the static method to process data
            result = DataProcessor.process()

class AdvancedProcessor:
    """
    Facilitates advanced data processing by coordinating multiple processing components.

    The `AdvancedProcessor` class is designed to manage and execute complex data processing workflows by integrating the functionalities of `HelperClass` and `DataProcessor`. It is ideal for scenarios where a comprehensive processing sequence is needed, providing a streamlined approach to handle data operations and produce a final result.

    This class fits into the larger system architecture as a high-level orchestrator of data processing tasks, ensuring that each component's capabilities are effectively utilized to achieve the desired outcome.

    Example:
        # Initialize the AdvancedProcessor
        processor = AdvancedProcessor()

        # Execute the processing workflow
        result = processor.run()
        print(result)  # Output: 'utility'

    Attributes:
        helper (HelperClass): An instance of `HelperClass` used to manage data processing tasks.
        data_processor (DataProcessor): An instance of `DataProcessor` used to perform specific data processing operations.

        Executes the complete data processing workflow and returns the result.

        This method coordinates the data processing tasks by utilizing both the `HelperClass` and `DataProcessor` to perform necessary operations. It is designed to be used when a full processing sequence is required, culminating in a final result that indicates the completion of these tasks.

        Returns:
            str: The result of the processing workflow, typically a utility string indicating successful completion.

        Example:
            # Create an instance of AdvancedProcessor
            processor = AdvancedProcessor()

            # Run the processing workflow
            result = processor.run()

        """
        Returns a utility string as the result of processing.

        This method is part of the `AdvancedProcessor` class workflow, providing a consistent utility value after processing operations. It is typically used when a placeholder or generic result is needed following the execution of data processing tasks within the class.

        Returns:
            str: The string 'utility', serving as a generic utility value to indicate the completion of processing tasks.
